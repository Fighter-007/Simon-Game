# Simon Game
 Creating the classic Simon Game using html, CSS, JS and jQuery
 
 

### What's the game about?
It tests the retaining capacity of the player as they've to replicate the pattern that the Simon shows!

### How to Play?
1. Press any key to begin
2. The Simon blinks one of the colour keys. Remember that.
3. Now, press that colour key.
4. Simon gives you a new signal now if you pressed the right key.
5. Now, first press the key that Simon indicated first followed by the next.
6. So, your job is to retain the sequence in which the colours have to be pressed and replicate it, failing to which the game gets over and you can start all over again.
7. Have fun playing it!

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS (with jQuery Library)
